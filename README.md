# 18.905 Notes

These are my notes for Algebraic Topology (18.905) at MIT during Fall 2020.
I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these notes, because they were
quickly typed up (mostly) during the lecture with minimal proofreading.
I take responsibility for all errors found in the document.
Pull requests for typos/mathematical mistakes welcome!
